# gtkrs_discord_testing

A quick gtk + rust Discord app to discover and try stuff

##### Doesn't work anymore - for now at least -, endpoint used is now bot only

# To get started

``` bash
# Refer to the usual cargo commands like:
cargo run
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

# To be able to run the app, you need the following set env variables:
USER_TOKEN=your_user_token
CONTACT_ID=your_contact_discriminator_id (to only get your contact's messages)
CONTACT_CHANNEL_ID=your_contact_channel_id (to answer back to this contact)
